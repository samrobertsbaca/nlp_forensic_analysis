ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis, chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt. Bouro. Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos.
Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend. In his email he described a once bountiful region now distressed by contamination, struggling to find solutions to a worsening problem. I decided to investigate.
""We didn't make the connection at first,"" Reese told me when I met with him at his office. ""The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away. After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production. We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better. Then when the kids started getting sick we took a harder look at what could have changed.""
The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys.
Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys. The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company. With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis.
With a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms. A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a café where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home. Families have lived in Elodis for generations.
""We've made a good living for a long time,"" Reese tells me. ""The population has been steadily increasing. Crop production has been good. For the most part, kids haven't left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places. We have a lot of land that could yet be developed. There was a future for them here.""
I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations. He introduced me to a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.
I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor. Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.

The change turned out to be international GAStech, an international corporation directed by Sten Sanjorge Jr, tycoon of the business outside Tethys.
Established in 1961, the corporation of GAStech began like had business family who provided services that carried the premises in Tethys.

I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at Ferro Hardware store to repair a broken tractor. Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.
""We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more,"" Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size. ""Over the years we've added a few hectares here and there. It keeps us busy.""
Busy is an understatement, as I found when I prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more.
""I usually head to the fields before sun up,"" Mr. Henk Bodrogi tells me. ""My wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner. When the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark.""
""We do this most days,"" he adds, ""except for worship days.""
Bodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase.
""We all know one another here,"" Bodrogi explains as we leave. ""Most families have lived here for generations. The first new people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back.""
I ask Bodrogi if business has been good.
""We were doing pretty good until recently. Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment. Then we started having all this trouble with the crops.""
In what way, I asked.
""The crops aren't producing like they have in the past. It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist. When they tested it they said the water was contaminated.""
Bodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home. The tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day. I thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town.
The water specialist turned out to be the international agency ""Wellness For All"", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development.
I caught up with a representative from Wellness for All the next day. Joclyn Reynolds is project coordinator for ""Wellness for All"". She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis.
""We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local water. In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen. The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream. We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream. Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins. ""
""Can these substances occur naturally?"" I asked her.
""Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly. Groundwater contamination is usually the result of human activity. The GAStech pipes are releasing contaminants into a pond. The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops.""
""Did you talk to GAStech about this?""
""Oh yes,"" she replied. ""At first we believed we were gaining traction. We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, Hank Fluss. He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts. After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who makes the decisions. It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or the environment.""
Sten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices.
""When we didn't make headway with GAStech,"" Reynolds continued, ""the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance. Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document. The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.

I caught up with myself compared to Henk Bodrogi downtown making of the purchases to the ferro store of material to repair a broken tractor. Bodrogi cultivated soya its life whole, just as his/her father and their fathers. I questioned it about his life with the farm.
""We worked the ground for a long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a little more,"" Henk Bodrogi like it indicated to me selected above a container of bolts, seeking the good size. ""During years we added a few hectares here and there. It maintains occupied to us.""
Occupied is an undervaluation, as I found when I stabbed the stiff farmer to say myself more.
""Of I head usually to the fields before the sun to the top,"" Mr. Henk Bodrogi indicates to me. ""My wife obtains the high children and titrates to inform, then it will do something so that us eat for the lunch and function beside me until the dinner. When the children become at the house of the school they make their drudgeries, and we are all backs at the house the majority of the times by the darkness.""
""We make these majority of the days,"" it is added, ""except days of worship.""
Bodrogi identifies the suitable bolt and causes with the cash clerk about the children and of the school while it achieves his purchase.
""All let us know We here another,"" Bodrogi explains while we leave. ""The majority of the families lived here for generations. The first new people who came to the city were with this gas company which established the back of a few years.""
I ask Bodrogi if the businesses were good.
""We made very good until recently. The benefit were good and we add cultivated surface, or improve the equipment. Then we started to have all this trouble with harvests.""
How, I asked.
""Harvests do not produce as they have in the past. That removed one moment with the figure, then one of the leaders of city illustrated outside to call in a water specialist. When they examined it they said that water was soiled.""
Bodrodgi sighed, and with a glance encircled in its eye it thanked me for my interest and says had it to me to direct the back house. The tractor had to be fixed before they could function the next day. I thanked it and observed it rise in its truck and head out of the city.
The water specialist proved to be the international agency ""health for all"", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to the communities afflicted by normal disasters, outlines and - coincidentally - oil and formation of gas.
I caught up with myself compared to a representative of health for the whole the next day. Joclyn Reynolds is a coordinator of project for ""health for all"". It spoke to me above a satellite call its office field in South-East Asia where it was efforts of relief of establishment following an earthquake. Mrs. Reynolds agreed to speak to me during a few minutes between the meetings about their work in Elodis.
""We were contacted by a civil servant of city about a problem which they had with water their room. In years of the last agriculture was effondue, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had gone up. The drinking water of Elodis comes from the river of Tiskele, just as any water for the leasing, thus we sought a source upstream. We found sources of provision of reject of production to the <km> of operation of GAStech ascending. The tests showed the high levels of benzene, toluene, the xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, between other toxins.  ""
""Can these substances occur naturally?"" I asked him.
""Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly. The subsoil water contamination is usually the result of the human activity. The pipes of GAStech discharge from the contaminants in a pond. The toxins form a feather with ground flower which infiltrates in the river of Tiskele of which residents of the aspiration of Elodis their drinking water and irrigation for harvests.""
""You spoke in GAStech on this subject?""
The ""OH yes,"" it answered. ""In the beginning we believed that we gain traction. We met several times with representatives of GAStech, including one of the senior executive, Fluss hank. It personally ensured us that GAStech would act in a responsible way to provide to the material aid and financial worms of the efforts of cleaning. After one moment, although, it appeared clearly that while Mr. Fluss was serious it was Sanjorge which makes the decisions. It is obvious that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest for the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or environment.""
Sten Sanjorge, Jr., which had inherited its share to the company of his/her father in 1990, had developed a reputation for pitiless procedures of management.
""When we did not make progress with GAStech,"" Reynolds continued, ""the chiefs of the community decided to approach the government of Kronos for the assistance. By our policy - and with the permission of the chiefs of Elodis - we published the test results in an official public document. The chiefs of Elodis then approached the civils servant of government as citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis. Our agency ensured that we would be still available to help in some way when these agreements were completed. ""
