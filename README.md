## Project Description

It is January 20, 2014 and employees at GasTech are missing - possibly abducted. The Protector of Kronos (POK) organization is suspected in the kidnapping. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Named Entity Recognition, and network graphs are the forensic analysis tools utilized to inform law enforcement. Two explanations were presented based on company emails, published articles, and corporate structure datasets.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept in the following files:
  1. [A map of Kronos](https://github.com/samrobertsbaca/nlp_forensic_analysis/blob/main/A_Map_of_Kronos.jpg)
  2. [A chart describing the local GAStech organization, in PDF format.](https://github.com/samrobertsbaca/nlp_forensic_analysis/blob/main/GAStechKronos-org-chart.pdf)
  3. [A spreadsheet of GAStech employee records, in Microsoft Excel format.](https://github.com/samrobertsbaca/nlp_forensic_analysis/blob/main/EmployeeRecords.xlsx)
  4. [Email headers from two weeks of internal GAStech company email, in comma-separated values
(CSV) format](https://github.com/samrobertsbaca/nlp_forensic_analysis/blob/main/email%20headers.csv)
  5. [Resumes and short biographies of many, (but not all), of the GAStech employees, in Microsoft
Word format](https://github.com/samrobertsbaca/nlp_forensic_analysis/tree/main/resumes)
  6. [Historical reports and descriptions of the countries involved, in Microsoft Word format](https://github.com/samrobertsbaca/nlp_forensic_analysis/tree/main/HistoricalDocuments)
  7. [Relevant current and historical news reports from multiple domestic and translated foreign
sources, in text file format.](https://github.com/samrobertsbaca/nlp_forensic_analysis/tree/main/articles)
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/samrobertsbaca/nlp_forensic_analysis/blob/main/ForensicAnalysis_Project.ipynb).
